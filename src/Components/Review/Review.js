                <p>Great medical office, wonderful and warm experience from start to finish. Appreciate <span className='text-danger fw-bolder'>Dr. Mohamed Nakeshbandi</span> taking time to go over the diagnosis clearly and treatment options. Was referred over by my general doctor and can see why. Highly recommended.</p>

                <p>Wonderful experience with <span className='text-danger fw-bolder'>Doctor Bari</span>. and <span className='text-danger fw-bolder'>Dr.Asma Khapra</span> is incredible. Not only has she taken great care of my health, but also she is lovely to speak with at every appointment. Itâ€™s rare to find a doctor that combines such personal touches and care for a patient as a person with outstanding quality of medical care. I highly recommend becoming her patient!</p>
